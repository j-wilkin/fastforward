Fastforward
========
A facebook app that teaches highschool students about college and university opportunities using their network and interests. Fastforward shows students a potential timeline to their dream career which they can achieve using online resources. This is a facebook app I built over Summer 2013 while at Unigo. Visit the site at fastforward.unigo.com and check out Unigo.com for college and university application resources.

Fastforward is built using Microsoft ASP.NET MVC4
